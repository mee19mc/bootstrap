<h2>disclaimers</h2>

<p>spice2x team does not provide any tools to circumvent software copy protection, nor distribute any copyright-protected game data.</p>

<p>We are not associated with the original SpiceTools developers.
  SpiceCompanion apps are also separate projects owned by the app developers.
  Efforts will be made to keep up to date with upstream changes.</p>

<p>
<strong>If you want to run spice2x on a real arcade cabinet, do note that the developers take no responsibility for any damage done to your hardware.</strong>

For example, some modes in certain games are known to push (practically permanent, difficult to reverse) firmware onto I/O boards, rendering them unusable.
While efforts have been made to hook some of these codes from running, there is no guarantee that this will always work (e.g., if newer version of the game decides to a
new method that isn't hooked). It is also no means comprehensive, as there may be yet-to-be-discovered code that may render your expensive hardware completely useless.
